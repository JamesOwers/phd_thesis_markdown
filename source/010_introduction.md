## Target problems addressed in this thesis

## Historical background
...TODO... Give historical background

### First instance of music generation
...TODO...
From Section 1.2 [@briot_deep_2019]

> The first music generated by computer appeared in 1957. It was a 17 seconds long melody named “The Silver Scale” by its author Newman Guttman and was generated by a software for sound synthesis named Music I, developed by Mathews at Bell Laboratories

### Mozart using mechanical aids for idea generation
...TODO...
From footnote 7 in Section 1.2 [@briot_deep_2019]

 > One of the first documented case of stochastic music, long before computers, is the Musikalisches Wurfelspiel (Dice Music) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It was designed for using dice to generate music by concatenating randomly selected predefined music segments composed in a given style (Austrian waltz in a given key).


### Ada lovelace noting computers could generate music
...TODO...
From [@hollings_ada_2018] Ada Lovelace, “Sketch of the Analytical Engine invented by Charles Babbage, Esq., by L. F. Menabrea”, Scientific Memoirs, vol. 3, ed. Richard Taylor, 1843, pp. 666-731 (this quote on p 694)

> “Note G” is the culmination of Lovelace’s paper, following many pages of detailed explanation of the operation of the Engine and the cards, and of the notation of the tables. The paper shows Lovelace’s obsessive attention to mathematical details - it also shows her imagination in thinking about the bigger picture.

> Lovelace overseed a fundamental principle of the machine, that the operations, defined by the cards, are separate from the data and the results. She observed that the machine might act upon things other than numbers, if those things satisfied mathematical rules.

> Supposing that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.

Lovelace also has the Lovelace Test of Creativity attributed to her - see [@ariza_interrogator_2009].

## What are algorithms that learn
...TODO... define/introduce machine learning

## What is composing music
...TODO...

## What does it mean to compose from scratch
...TODO... what is the minimum information we supply as a starting point? What feedback do we give?

## Motivation for this work
...TODO...

* why are we focussing on metrics and not human evaluation
* why do we care about 'from scratch'

## Scope of this work
...TODO... Symbolic music only
