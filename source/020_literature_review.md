## Models for composing music
...TODO... 
1. state of the art generative models for music - what are the problems people currently try to / can solve, and how do they do it
    1. Main point is to motivate need for better evaluation
    2. How do people address the issue of modelling long term dependencies - this is what we are going to aim to show is poorly evaluated


## Evaluation methods for creative models
...TODO... how to evaluate generative models with a focus on music - how do people evaluate their success

## Methods for representing music on a computer
...TODO... how to represent music data - (in relation to 'from scratch', what is the minimal information supplied to the models, and is there evidence of what difference it makes (either by experiment or just by reasoning?)
