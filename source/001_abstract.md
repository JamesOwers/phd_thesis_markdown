# Abstract {.unnumbered}

<!-- This is the abstract -->

Evaluating whether creative content generated by a computer is 'good', be it music, images, or text, is unsolved and not even well defined. We identify a property of music which is not modelled well, and propose new evaluation metrics for music generation which can be used to distinguish between real and generated data, and thus be useful for automatic quantitative analysis of generation quality. 

This is interesting because ...TODO... 
and it has implications for ...TODO...

Finally, we make recommendations for how to make progress with respect to music generation and related tasks.
